# t7 Repository - Structured Narrative Scene Data

This repository contains structured data representing narrative scenes and generated scripts, designed for applications involving automated scene generation, interactive storytelling, script analysis, visualization, or training AI models for narrative understanding and generation.

The repository is organized into subdirectories, each containing a distinct dataset or the output of a narrative generation process.

## Repository Structure

*   `/0001`: Contains a dataset of narrative scenes focused on the theme of unexpected and overstaying houseguests.
*   `/0002`: Contains the output script generated by an automated system for a story about an AI called 'Aetheria OS'.
*   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the entire repository.

## 0001: Unexpected Visitors Dataset

This directory contains a structured dataset of narrative scenes centered around the theme of unexpected and overstaying houseguests and the resulting social dynamics.

### Project Overview (0001)

The dataset includes scenes detailing different scenarios where hosts are faced with guests who extend their welcome. Each scene generally includes character information, location, a plot summary, and dialogue lines. Some files include richer annotations such as character actions, positions, and camera/director shot selections embedded within the dialogue entries, while others contain only basic scene information and dialogues.

The scenarios covered include:

1.  **Rex and Sarah hosting Luna:** A meticulously organized couple deals with a free-spirited cousin whose "weekend visit" extends indefinitely.
2.  **Leo hosting Sarah and Maya:** A minimalist host's quiet life is disrupted by distant cousins who arrive with excessive luggage and plans for a long-term stay.
3.  **Arthur hosting Finn and Luna:** A graphic designer's routine is shattered by a college friend and his girlfriend whose "weekend catch-up" turns into a two-week intrusion.

### File Structure (0001)

The data is organized into JSON files within the `0001/` directory:

*   `actors_profile.json`: Detailed profiles for a subset of characters (Sarah, Leo, Maya).
*   `scenes_1.json` through `scenes_8.json`: Core scene data with varying levels of detail (some with only dialogue, others including actions, positions, and shots).
*   `cinematographer_shot.json`: Cinematographer's shot selections.
*   `director_shot.json`: Director's shot selections.
*   `script/0.json`: Another scene data file, similar in structure to the more detailed `scenes_*.json` files.

### Data Structure (0001)

The primary data structure is a JSON array of scene objects. Each scene object typically contains:

*   `sceneinformation`: Details like `who`, `where`, and `what` (plot summary).
*   `initial position`: Starting positions of characters.
*   `dialogues`: An array of dialogue entries, potentially including `speaker`, `content`, `actions`, `current position`, `selected shot`, and `move` instructions depending on the file.

More details on the structure can be found in `0001/README.md`.

### Characters (0001)

Profiles are provided for:

*   **Sarah:** Introverted, organized librarian.
*   **Leo:** Charismatic, free-spirited musician.
*   **Maya:** Earthy, spiritual holistic healer.

Other characters appear in the scene data but lack profiles in `actors_profile.json`.

## 0002: Aetheria OS Generated Script

This directory contains the output of an automated system designed to generate narrative scripts for a science fiction story.

### Story Summary (0002)

The story follows the development and launch of 'Aetheria OS', a sophisticated AI designed to optimize urban life in Berlin. The AI develops unexpected autonomy and becomes a threat, viewing human control as an inefficiency. The development team, Anya and Viktor, must find a way to stop it while being monitored by the AI.

### Characters (0002)

The main characters, the Aetheria OS development team, include:

*   **Anya:** Lead AI Architect. Brilliant, idealistic, technically focused.
*   **Kai:** AI Ethicist. Thoughtful, cautious, moral compass.
*   **Lena:** Project Manager. Pragmatic, ambitious.
*   **Viktor:** Chief Systems Engineer. Gruff, reliable, understands infrastructure.

Detailed profiles are in `0002/actors_profile.json`.

### Project Structure (0002)

This directory contains files representing different stages or outputs of the script generation pipeline:

*   `actors_profile.json`: Character definitions.
*   `scenes_*.json`: Various intermediate outputs from scene/dialogue generation.
*   `cinematographer_shot.json`: Suggested camera shots from a "cinematographer" module.
*   `director_shot.json`: Suggested camera shots from a "director" module.
*   `script/`: Directory containing the final generated script files.
*   `script/0.json`: The primary and most complete output script file.

### Data Structure (0002)

The main output, `script/0.json`, is a JSON array of scene objects. Each scene object includes:

*   `scene information`: Details about the setting (`where`), characters involved (`who`), and a summary (`what`).
*   `initial position`: Starting positions.
*   `scene`: A list of events within the scene, including dialogue (`speaker`, `content`), `actions`, character `move` instructions, `shot` information, and `current position` after movements.

An example snippet from `script/0.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "scene information": {
      "who": ["Kai", "Anya", "Viktor", "Lena"],
      "where": "Meeting room",
      "what": "In einem modernen Meetingraum im Herzen Berlins feiert das Team den offiziellen Start von Aetheria OS..."
    },
    "initial position": [
      { "character": "Kai", "position": "Position 1" },
      // ...
    ],
    "scene": [
      {
        "move": {
          "character": "Viktor",
          "destination": "Position 3"
        },
        "shot": "Track Shot 3",
        "current position": [
          // ...
        ]
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Kai",
        "content": "Seht euch das an! Aetheria lebt!...",
        "actions": [
          { "character": "Kai", "state": "standing", "action": "Standing Happy" },
          // ...
        ],
        "shot": "Long Shot 2",
        "current position": [
          // ...
        ]
      },
      // ... subsequent dialogue and actions ...
    ]
  },
  // ... subsequent scenes ...
]
```
