# t7 Repository - Structured Narrative Scene Data

This repository, `deniskropp/t7`, serves as a collection point for structured data representing narrative scenes. The primary goal is to provide detailed, machine-readable scene information suitable for various applications in narrative understanding, generation, and visualization, such as automated scene generation, script analysis, interactive storytelling, or training AI models.

## Repository Structure

The core data is organized within subdirectories, typically representing different projects, datasets, or versions. Currently, the main dataset is located in the `0001/` directory.

*   `0001/`: Contains a specific set of narrative scenes focused on the theme of unexpected houseguests, along with character profiles and different layers of scene annotation (dialogue, actions, positions, shots).

## Detailed Data Information

For a complete description of the data contained within the `0001/` directory, including the project overview, file structure, data formats, character details, and potential uses, please refer to the dedicated README file:

*   [`0001/README.md`](0001/README.md)

This subdirectory README provides in-depth information about the specific dataset, its structure, and how it can be interpreted and utilized.

## Usage

The data within this repository is primarily intended for programmatic access and analysis. Developers and researchers can parse the JSON files to extract scene information, character actions, dialogue, and camera details for their applications.

Refer to the [`0001/README.md`](0001/README.md) for specific details on the structure of the JSON files within that directory.
